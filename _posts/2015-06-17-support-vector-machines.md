Part of my new job involves developing data-driven models for user behaviour and other metrics. I've read quite a bit about common machine learning algorithms, and used them in examples and toy models, but in the first few weeks at work I have had a chance to actually *use* some of these algorithms on real-world problems. 

One thing I've come to understand a lot better is one of my favourite classification algorithms, the [support vector machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine) (SVM). I had always had in the back of my head that this algorithm is nothing more than a generalisation of a two-dimensional [decision boundary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_boundary) optimisation problem to higher dimensions, but now I've had to use the model a little more deeply, I think I have a better idea of its subtleties.
