This week I finally decided to buy a subscription to the Sydney Morning Herald website. My reasoning was not because of how irritating it was to subvert their piteous paywall all the time (as easy as opening things in Incognito tabs in Google Chrome; slightly more annoying on my phone), but rather to do with the state of journalism in Australia.

It's no secret that the Sydney Morning Herald sucks way more now than it used to, and in addition the website sucks way more than the print version (though this is mainly to do with placement and prioritising of articles rather than content). But rather than complaining about how much it sucks, as someone who strongly believes in the role the media has to play in a democracy, I thought maybe I should actually do something about it.

Other than reading alternative news sources like The Guardian and New Matilda, which I do, I feel it is also appropriate of me to support Australia's oldest newspaper, and the only bulwark against News Ltd domination of our press. Maybe if enough people change their minds and support Fairfax with their money, and with their opinion (I'm sending this as an email to Fairfax as well), they will be able to afford better journalists, will appreciate more of their income is coming from people who read and desire real news, and adjust their business model accordingly.
